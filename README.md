Here is the code for the telegram bot for my final work in the center.

# Telegram-bot
This repository contains my project - Telegram bot for the "Coaching and Facilitation Workshop by Evgenia Vyrvich"

 ## Project functionality

The project functionality includes the following functions:

~ "About Us" button containing general information about the organizers

~ The "Our Programs" button, containing information about all possible "Workshop" programs

~ Button "Evgenia Vyrvich", containing information about the achievements of the main organizer and coach

## Why is my project relevant?
My project is relevant because:

~ There is a customer, therefore there is a need to use

~ As of January 2023, Telegram has over 700 million monthly active users

~ It is estimated that today more than 25% of companies worldwide use coaching as part of their talent development strategy.

## What didn't work out?

Unfortunately it didn't work out:

~ Button "For admin". This button should have asked the user (namely the admin) for a password

~ The output of user data to the browser window using the Flet framework is not implemented (this was supposed to be an improvised database)

## For more details, see the repository itself.
